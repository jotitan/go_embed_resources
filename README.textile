h1. Embed static resources in web application in go

To avoid copy specific folder with resources, this tool can generate a go file containing all static data.
When go webapp start, it create folder if necesssary.

h2. Installation

* Build the tool with <code>go build generate_resources.go</code>
* Copy executable in go tool folder (GOROOT/pkg/tool/windows_amd64|linux|.../)
* You can use executable with *go tool generate_resources*

To use go generate, you need at least go 1.5.

h2. Usage


Create a go file in your go sources files (/src) with a go:generate commentary : 

<code>
//go:generate go tool generate_resources _resources_folder_ _package_name_ _resources_destination_
</code>

Example : if you want to generate the go file in package action, your resources are in ../resources and you want to place resources in folder static_folder, you'll write : 

<code>
//go:generate go tool generate_resources ../resources action static_folder
</code>

A file name autogenerate_resources.go is created in folder action with unique function init which will be called at startup.

Can you also used tool executable directly by calling him with good parameters, no need to use go generate in this case.
