Create a go file in your go sources files (/src) with a go:generate commentary : 

//go:generate go tool generate_resources *resources_folder* *package_name* *resources_destination*

Exemple : if you want to generate the go file in package action, your resources are in ../resources and you want to place resources in folder static_folder : 

//go:generate go tool generate_resources ../resources action static_folder

A file name autogenerate_resources.go is created in folder action with unique function init which will be called at startup.
